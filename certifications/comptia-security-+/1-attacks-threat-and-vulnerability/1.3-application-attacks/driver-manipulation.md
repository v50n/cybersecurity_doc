# Driver Manipulation

The traditional anti-virus is good to detech the know attacks/malware by signature. BUT There are still ways to bypass this by using a 0day, new attack types etc..&#x20;



## Driver manipulation

* The driver is a program allowing the OS to work with the hardware (keyboard, audio etc....)&#x20;
* They are often trusted.&#x20;
* Example for HP audio drivers (2016), that enables a keylogger....&#x20;

## Shimming

Some program in microsoft allow to chose an older version to work with. Place for some CVE :)&#x20;

## Malware Unique Signature

Refactoring the code to have new signature each time the program was compile.&#x20;

HOW ???&#x20;

* Add NOP instructions
* Add loops pointless code strings
* Can intelligently redesign itself:&#x20;
  * Reorder functions
  * Modify application flow
  * Insert unused data types
